- Hi, I am Angela Pacatte.
- I am finishing up The University of Texas in Austin Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.
- The bootcamp has been a fun challenge where I have excelled and completed each module with a grade of 97 or above.
- I am a nurse of 16 years and have so much to offer with my experiences in that field.
- Nursing requires resiliency, continuing education, conflict resolution, versatility and so much more that will transfer to any job.
