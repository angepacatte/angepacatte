- Hi, I am Angela Pacatte.
- I have a Data Analysis and Visualization Certificate from the University of Texas McCombs School of Business
- The bootcamp has been a fun challenge where I have excelled and completed each module with a grade of 97 or above.
- I am a nurse who was ready to learn how to utilize all the unused data in healthcare.
- Nursing requires resiliency, continuing education, conflict resolution, versatility and so much more that will transfer to any job.
