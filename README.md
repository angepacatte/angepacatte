- Hi, I am Angela Pacatte.
- I am finishing up The University of Texas in Austin Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.
- I am looking to get hired in a data analysis job very soon.  
- I have done well in the bootcamp and look forward to growing in my skills.
- I am a nurse of 16 years and have so much to offer with my experiences in that field.
- Nursing requires resiliency, continuing education, conflict resolution, versatility and so much more.
